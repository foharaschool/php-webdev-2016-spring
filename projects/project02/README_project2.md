You will create a program that logs your exercise activity and calculates the number of calories burned. The formula for determining calorie burn is:

    Male:
        ((-55.0969 + (0.6309 * HR) + (0.438278456 0.090174 * W) + (0.2017 * A)) / 4.184) * T
    Female:
        ((-20.4022 + (0.4472 * HR) â€“ (0.278443506 0.057288 * W) + (0.074 * A)) / 4.184) * T

Where:

    HR: Heart rate (in beats/minute)
    W: Weight (in pounds)
    A: Age (in years)
    T: Exercise duration time (in minutes)

This formula was taken from http://www.shapesense.com/fitness-exercise/calculators/heart-rate-based-calorie-burn-calculator.shtml

            Displayed from newest to oldest
            Each entry displayed will list:
                the date of the exercise
                the type of exercise
                the time in minutes
                the average heart rate
                the calories burned
                Each entry must contain a link to remove it from the database
    You must have a database with an exercise_log table that contains the following fields:
        id (set as the primary key)
        user_id (for linking to the exercise_user table
        date
        type
        time_in_minutes
        heartrate
    Your database will also have an exercise_user table that contains the following fields:
        id (st as the primary key)
        first_name
        last_name
        gender

NOTE: creating a separate table for users is more useful if you were to create a login system for multiple users. See extra credit below.

    All field entries must be validated
    All field entries must be sticky

Extra Credit: 5 points

    Add the ability to have multiple users
    This will require you to add a password column to the exercise_user table
